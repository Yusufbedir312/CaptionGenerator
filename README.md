"The repository contains code for projects I completed for two related courses I took in one semester at university. These courses focused on Artificial Neural Networks and ANLP (Arabic Natural Language Processing).

Thanks to these projects, I achieved 3rd place in a competition held by one of my professors and was honoured by the head of my department.
